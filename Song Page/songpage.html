    </h2>
<p style="text-align:center;font-weight:bold;">The sun sets longer<br>
Where I am from<br>
Where dreams go to die<br>
While having fun...<br>
The boys fix their cars and<br>
Girls eat it up<br>
Loving's so good when<br>
Love is young<br>
<br>
(Yeah) There's so much history in these streets<br>
And mama's good eats<br>
Oh Wonder on repeat<br>
There's so much history in my head<br>
The people I've left<br>
The ones that I've kept<br>
<br>
Have you heard me on the radio?<br>
Did you turn it up?<br>
On your blown-out stereo<br>
In suburbia...<br>
Could be playing hide and seek from home<br>
Can't replace my blood<br>
Yeah, it seems I'm never letting go<br>
Of suburbia...<br>
<br>

Swallow nostalgia<br>
Chase it with lime<br>
Better than dwelling<br>
And chasing time<br>
Missing occasions<br>
I can't rewind<br>
Can't help but feel I've lost what's mine<br>
<br>
Yeah, there's so much history in these streets<br>
And mama's good eats<br>
Oh Wonder on repeat<br>
There's so much history in my head<br>
The people I've left<br>
The ones that I've kept <br>
<br>
Have you heard me on the radio?<br>
Did you turn it up?<br>
On your blown-out stereo<br>
In suburbia<br>
Could be playing hide and seek from home<br>
Can't replace my blood<br>
Yeah, it seems I'm never letting go<br>
Of suburbia<br>
<br>
They all say that nothing ever changes<br>
Through the new lines<br>
That are on their faces<br>
They all say that nothing ever changes<br>
Through the new lines<br>
That are on their faces<br>
<br>
Yeah, there's so much history in these streets<br>
And mama's good eats<br>
Oh Wonder on repeat<br>
There's so much history in my head<br>
The people I've left<br>
The ones that I've kept <br>
<br>
Have you heard me on the radio?<br>

On your blown-out stereo<br>
In suburbia<br>
Could be playing hide and seek from home<br>
Can't replace my blood<br>
Yeah, it seems I'm never letting go<br>
Of suburbia<br>
